# ai-racecar
Normally, I'm doing development with Java or NodeJS, but after setting up some small projects with Raspberry PI 4 and Python, I decided to learn more about AI.
Some day, I found an article about Donkey Cars and since then, I wanted to have such a thing up and running. This holiday season, I then decided to start this project.

# My rc car (Hardware)
I followed this link [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetracer/blob/master/docs/tamiya/bill_of_materials.md)

If you want to order the parts in Germany, check out:
 - [Amazon (DE)](https://amazon.de)
 - [ELV](https://elv.com)
 - [Mouser](https://mouser.com)
 - [Sertronics](https://sertronics.shop)
 - [Just3DP](https://just3dp.com)

If you can not find one othe parts in these shops, just get in touch with me.

# Additional tasks to get everything up and running (Software)
...tbd
Just one hint for beginners: Start with the image of JetCard listed in the repo of NVIDIAs' jetracer project. I tried to set up everything from scratch but when I was almost done, I run into an error with an old version of an shared object that forced me to rollback for now.
